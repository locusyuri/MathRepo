>(1)Axiom of Extensionality:If X and Y have the same elements,then X=Y
>(2)Axiom of Pairing:For any a and b there exists a set $\{ a,b \}$ that contains exactly a and b
>(3)Axiom Schema of Serperation:If P is a property (with parameter p),then for any X and p there exists a set $Y=\{ u\in X:P(u,p) \}$ that contains all those $u\in X$ that have property P(It menas that we can SERPERATE a set B which satisfy peoperty P from the set A)
>(4)Axiom of Union:For any X there exists a set $Y=\bigcup X$,the union of all elements of X
>(5)Axioms of Power Set:For any X there exists a set $Y=P(X)$,the set of all subsets of X
>(6)Axiom of Infinity:There exists an infinite set 
>(7)Axiom Schema of Replacement:If a class F is a function,then for any X there exists a set $Y=F(X)=\{ F(x):x\in X \}$
>(8)Axiom of Regularity:Every nonempty set has an $\in-minimal\,element$ 
>(9)Axiom of Choice:Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function

>[!note] 
>Intuitively,a set is a collection of all elements that satisfy a certain given property.In other words,we might be tempted to postulate the following rule of formation for sets:
>**Axiom Schema of Comprehension**(FALSE):If P is a property,then there exists a set $Y=\{ x:P(x) \}$ 
>This principle, however, is false:
>**Russell's Paradox:** Consider the set S whose elements are all those (and only those) sets that are not members of themselves:$S=\{ X:X\not\in X \}$. Question: Does S belongs to S? We have a contradiction. 
>Thus we must conclude that $\{ X:X\not\in X \}$ is not a set.
